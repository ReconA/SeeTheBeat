## Project description

This project is inspired by the cover of a pink floyd album, A Saucerful of Secrets from 1968. This artwork is made of multiple drawing, put together without any particulare order. The result is abstract but very interesting. When we begin the project, we were wondering if a computer could by programm to do the same kind of work. 

Our objectif with this project is to use a computer to generate image that will look like the original cover from pink floyd, but any kind of song. To do so, we are using lyrics and audio from the song to create the new cover. 

see_the_beat load the song and the lyrics. Based on the lenght of the song, it selects the number of images that the programm will try to download. Based on the lyrics, the programm create a markov chain that will be used to generate short setences of 3 or less words. Those setences must contain at least a noun or a proposition. 

After having generate some setence, the system uses bing search engine from Microsoft to look online for pictures that should match the query (or the setences generated by the markov chain). 

The system then download a random picture from the set of picture returned by bing. 

On the otherhand, the system analyse the audio audio and start to draw shape on the 256x256 canvas image. Those shape will be used to insert part of the downloaded images.
